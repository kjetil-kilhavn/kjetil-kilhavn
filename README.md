- 👋 Hi, I’m @kjetil-kilhavn, or Kjetil Kilhavn if you will
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, including archery and free software
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use git properly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free SAP software and have contributed to other free software before (translations and funding, not coding) with the first being a translation of Animated Mouse Pointers for OS/2 - many, many moons ago!
- 📫 How to reach me ... ask your favourite search engine! It should come up with a phone number, and possibly one or more email addresses and/or social media accounts
